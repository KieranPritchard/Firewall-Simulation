## Project Description

### Objective
To simulate basic network packet flow and firewall behavior using both C++ and Python, to build an understanding of packet inspection, and rule-based filtering.

### Features

* Simulates both incoming and outgoing via fake network packets.
* Randomly generates dummy IP addresses, ports, and protocols (TCP/UDP).
* Dynamically creates firewall rules to allow or deny traffic.
* Uses a list of common vulnerable ports for realistic simulation.
* Combines sender and receiver traffic for randomized processing order.
* Includes both Python and C++ versions for comparison and practice with the latter.
* Comes with a Bash helper script for compiling C++.

### Technologies and Tools Used

Languages: C++ and Python
Libraries (Python): random
Libraries (C++): <vector>, <string>, <unordered_set>, <random>, <ctime>
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Bash, g++

### Challenges Faced

Coming up with a close to life solution for making pretend packets while keeping the logic simple enough for simulation was a key challenge. Translating the code between C++ and Python also highlighted differences in syntax, data handling, and randomization methods which stumped me in places. While it was not generated by AI. AI was used to explain new concepts for me like vectors for example which are just resizable lists and fix errors that left me really stumped. 

### Outcome

Successfully created a console-based packet simulation tool that mimics basic firewall behavior. The program dynamically generates packets, constructs rules, and evaluates whether packets are allowed or denied.
This project improved understanding of C++ randomization, Python translation, and network logic modeling.

## How to Use the Project
### Option 1 – Python Version
- Run the Script
```python firewall_simulation.py```
- Observe the Output
- The console will display packets being processed and either allowed or denied.
- Customize or edit the lists of vulnerable ports or packet counts inside the file to adjust behavior.

### Option 2 – C++ Version
- Manual Compilation
- Compile:
```
g++ -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O2 firewall_simulation.cpp -o firewall_simulation.exe
```
- Run: `./firewall_simulation.exe`
- Using the Bash Script (Recommended)
```
bash compile.sh firewall_simulation.cpp
```
- This script verifies that g++ is installed.
- Compiles with the latest C++ standard available (C++26 or C++23).
- Outputs a clean .exe file ready to run.
